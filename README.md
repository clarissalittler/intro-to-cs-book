# intro-to-cs-book
This is a repo for the intro to computer science/programming book I've been writing.

The main branch is for the copy that I've been picking away at, but I've been feeling very stuck on it, and I don't think the code is idiomatic enough, so I'm starting a new branch that will be in Javascript as I think I might be able to convey what I want a lot better that way.

It is, I think, the result of the fact that Python just doesn't seem to match how I like to think and I'm not sure why. Honestly, it might be the fact that I'm very *very* centered on proper lambda abstractions and the lack of them always leaves me feeling a bit off-kilter. I like teaching all the cute let-over-lambda style tricks as part of introductory programming.
